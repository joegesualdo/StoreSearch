// What is this view?
// This will be a very simple view. It simply draws a black circular gradient that goes from a mostly opaque in the corners to mostly transparent in the center. Itâ€™s a similar dimmed background that you used to see behind UIAlertViews on iOS 6 and earlier. Placed on a white background, it looks like this:

#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

@interface GradientView : UIView

@end
